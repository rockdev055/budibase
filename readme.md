# Status
- [x] Alpha: We are demoing Budibase to users and receiving feedback
- [x] Private Beta: We are testing Budibase with a closed set of customers
- [x] Public Beta: Anyone can [sign-up and use Budibase](https://portal.budi.live/signup) but it's not production ready. We cannot ensure backwards compatibility
- [ ] Official Launch: Production-ready


We are currently in Public Beta. Until our official launch, we cannot ensure backwards compatibility for your budibase applications between versions. Issues may arise when trying to edit apps created with old versions of the budibase builder.

Watch "releases" of this repo to get notified of major updates, and give the star button a click whilst you're there.

### Not Sure Where to Start?
Budibase is a monorepo managed by lerna. Lerna manages the building and publishing of the budibase packages. At a high level, here are the packages that make up budibase.

- packages/builder - contains code for the budibase builder client side svelte application.

- packages/client - A module that runs in the browser responsible for reading JSON definition and creating living, breathing web apps from it.

- packages/server - The budibase server. This Koa app is responsible for serving the JS for the builder and budibase apps, as well as providing the API for interaction with the database and file system.
