# Getting Started with Budibase

(For contributors - scroll down)

### 1. Global install budibase

`npm install -g budibase`

### 2. Start using Budibase

Create a directory to store your Budibase apps

`mkdir my-budibase`

`cd my-budibase`

Initialise Budibase in current directory

`budi init`

Create a new Budibase app

`budi new my-app`

Run Budibase

`budi`

You can now access the Budibase builder on http://localhost:4001/_builder

Start building!

Once you have created your app, you need to create yourself an instance of your app (i.e. a database)

`budi instance my-app`

## Getting Started for Contributors

### 1.  Prerequisites

*yarn -* `npm install -g yarn`

*jest* - `npm install -g jest`

### 2. Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/Budibase/budibase.git`

then `cd ` into your local copy...

### 3.  Install and Build

`yarn` to install project dependencies

`yarn bootstrap` will install all budibase modules

`yarn build` will build all budibase packages

`yarn initialise` will initialise your budibase (i.e. create local database)

### 4. Running

A Budibase apps folder will have been created in `packages/server/myapps`. This is a blank apps folder, so you will need to create yourself an app:

```
cd packages/server
yarn run budi new your-app-name
```

now build and publish the latest budibase libs, to your new app

```
cd ../..
# now back in the root of the repository
yarn run publishdev
```

then

run the budibase server and builder in dev mode (i.e. with hot reloading):

1. Open a new console
2. `yarn dev` (from root)
3. Access the builder on http://localhost:4001/_builder/

This will enable watch mode for both the client AND the server.

### Running Commands from /server Directory

Notice that when inside `packages/server`, you can use any Budibase CLI command via yarn:

e.g. `yarn budi new mikes_app` == `budi new mikes_app`

This will use the CLI directly from `packages/cli`, rather than your globally installed `budi`
