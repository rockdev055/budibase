### Self hosting
This directory contains utilities that are needed for self hosted platforms to operate.
These will mostly be utilities, necessary to the operation of the server e.g. storing self
hosting specific options and attributes to CouchDB.

All the internal operations should be exposed through the `index.js` so importing
the self host directory should give you everything you need.
