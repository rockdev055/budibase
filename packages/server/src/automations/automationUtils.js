 * When running mustache statements to execute on the context of the automation it possible user's may input mustache
 * in a few different forms, some of which are invalid but are logically valid. An example of this would be the mustache
 * statement "{{steps[0].revision}}" here it is obvious the user is attempting to access an array or object using array
 * like operators. These are not supported by Mustache and therefore the statement will fail. This function will clean up
 * the mustache statement so it instead reads as "{{steps.0.revision}}" which is valid and will work. It may also be expanded
 * to include any other mustache statement cleanup that has been deemed necessary for the system.
 *
 * @param {string} string The string which *may* contain mustache statements, it is OK if it does not contain any.
 * @returns {string} The string that was input with cleaned up mustache statements as required.

/**

 * with mustache syntax to get the number from the rest of the context. To support this the server has to make sure that
 * the post mustache statement can be cast into the correct type, this function does this for numbers and booleans.
 *
 * @param {object} inputs An object of inputs, please note this will not recurse down into any objects within, it simply
 * cleanses the top level inputs, however it can be used by recursively calling it deeper into the object structures if
 * the schema is known.
 * @param {object} schema The defined schema of the inputs, in the form of JSON schema. The schema definition of an
 * automation is the likely use case of this, however validate.js syntax can be converted closely enough to use this by
 * wrapping the schema properties in a top level "properties" object.
 * @returns {object} The inputs object which has had all the various types supported by this function converted to their
 * primitive types.
